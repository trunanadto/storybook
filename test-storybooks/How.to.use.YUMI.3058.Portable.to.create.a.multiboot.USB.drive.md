The first thing you need to do is to select the USB drive that you want to use for creating the multiboot USB drive. Make sure that the drive has enough space for all the ISO files that you want to add and that it does not contain any important data, as it will be formatted during the process.
 
Next, you need to select the distribution that you want to add to the USB drive from the drop-down menu under Step 2. You can choose from a variety of categories such as Windows Installer, Linux Distributions, Antivirus Tools, System Tools, etc.
 
After selecting the distribution, you need to browse for the ISO file that corresponds to it by clicking on Browse under Step 3. You can download the ISO files from their respective websites or use any other source that you trust.
 
## Step 3: Add more distributions (optional)
 
If you want to add more than one distribution to the USB drive, you can repeat Step 2 for each distribution that you want to add. You can add as many distributions as your USB drive can hold.
 
However, keep in mind that some distributions may not be compatible with each other or with YUMI, so you may encounter some errors or issues during the booting process.
 
To remove a distribution from the USB drive, you can select it from the drop-down menu under Step 4 and click on Remove Installed Distro.
 
## Step 4: Create the multiboot USB drive
 
Once you have added all the distributions that you want to include in your multiboot USB drive, you can click on Create under Step 5 to start the process.
 
You will see a warning message that tells you that all data on your USB drive will be erased and asks
